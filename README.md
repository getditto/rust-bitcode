# Rust toolchain for Xcode-compatible iOS bitcode

In standard releases of Rust, the bitcode in ARM64 iOS targets is often
incompatible with Xcode because they use different versions of LLVM. This is a
[known issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35968) with no clear
long-term solution yet.

This repository contains scripts for building and installing a custom Rust
nightly toolchain where the Rust compiler's version of LLVM matches Xcode.
Software built using this toolchain can be included in bitcode-enabled apps that
will install on real iOS devices.

Binary releases of the toolchain will be created periodically and attached to
this repository, at least until there is a better upstream solution.

This repository is maintained by [Ditto](https://www.ditto.live). We use it
ourselves and want to share it for the benefit of the Rust iOS community! Please
create an issue if you notice any problems.

## Pre-compiled releases

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/getditto/rust-bitcode/releases) and
download a zip file. It will have a name of the form
`rust-ios-arm64-xxx.zip`.

Unzip the file and open a terminal to the extracted directory. Run the
installation script:

```
./install.sh
```

This will install the toolchain in `~/.rustup/toolchains/ios-arm64-xxx`.

## Build from source

1. Ensure required build tools are installed. If you are using homebrew: `brew
   install ninja cmake`
2. Clone this repository.
3. Review `config.sh` to make sure the the Rust and LLVM versions are suitable.
4. In a terminal, run `./build.sh`. This will clone the Rust and LLVM
   repositories under `build/` and compile them. The toolchain will end up
   at `build/rust-build/build/x86_64-apple-darwin/stage2`.
5. Run `./install.sh`. This will install the toolchain in
   `~/.rustup/toolchains/ios-arm64-1.46.0`, making it available in rustup.

## Using the toolchain

Build your library like this:

```
cargo +ios-arm64-1.46.0 build --target aarch64-apple-ios --release --lib
```
